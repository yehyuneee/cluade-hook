# Contributing to oh-my-harness

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Fork and clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/oh-my-harness.git
cd oh-my-harness

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build
```

## Development Workflow

This project follows **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**. All contributions must adhere to this workflow:

1. **Write a failing test first** — describe the expected behavior
2. **Verify the test fails** for the right reason
3. **Implement the minimum code** to make the test pass
4. **Refactor** while keeping tests green

### Branch Naming

Create a branch from `main` using the convention:

```
feat/add-something      # New feature
fix/broken-thing        # Bug fix
docs/update-readme      # Documentation
refactor/clean-up       # Code refactoring
test/add-missing-tests  # Test additions
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Type check
npm run lint
```

## What to Contribute

### Presets

Add a new preset by creating a directory in `presets/` with a `preset.yaml`. No code changes needed — the registry auto-discovers it. See `presets/_base/` for reference.

### Building Blocks

Add new hook templates in `src/catalog/blocks/`. Each block is a self-contained hook definition with parameters and a Handlebars template.

### Detectors

Add project detection for new languages/frameworks in `src/detector/detectors/`.

### Bug Fixes

Check [open issues](https://github.com/kyu1204/oh-my-harness/issues) for bugs to fix.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR
- All tests must pass (`npm test`)
- Type check must pass (`npm run lint`)
- Build must succeed (`npm run build`)
- Include tests for new functionality
- Write a clear PR description with **Summary** and **Test plan** sections

## Code Style

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any` types
- **Interfaces** over type aliases for object shapes
- **Explicit return types** on exported functions
- Keep it simple — avoid over-engineering

## Reporting Issues

When reporting a bug, please include:

- Node.js version (`node -v`)
- oh-my-harness version (`omh --version`)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Error output (if any)
